# NeurIPS2023 Creative AI Track
We are happy to announce the NeurIPS2023 Creative AI Track. This track will invite ML researchers to showcase their work during the conference in the form of visual, language, musical, and performing arts.

Proposals are due by **June 15, 2023.**

# Call for proposals
Note: The information below is the same as in [NeurIPS creative AI open call](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForCreativeAI).

### Theme: Celebrating Diversity

NeurIPS has a tradition of featuring the artistic skills of machine learning researchers, which was evident in events such as the NeurIPS workshop banquet summaries in the 1990s and 2000s, as well as the parties that showcased bands of machine learning researchers and art exhibitions. Given the recent surge in the use of machine learning generative models for creative art, it is an opportune time to revive this tradition and provide researchers with a platform to exhibit their creative tools and artwork that leverages machine learning technology.

For the first time this year, we are opening up **various locations throughout the conference venue to showcase NeurIPS art.** This will include hallway exhibits, designated spaces in the exhibit hall, screen time during breaks in the main conference room, as well as dedicated time and space during the reception and conference social events. We welcome all forms of art, including visual, language, musical, and performing arts, in order to celebrate the diversity of our community across gender, ethnicity, culture, affinity, and age. We are calling for proposals from ML research teams who are interested in showcasing their research work in the form of visual art such as pictures, paintings, media art, movies, sculptures, and installations, literary art such as short stories and poems, or performing arts such as staged theatrical work, dance, performed music, and happenings. All of which must be the result of applying machine learning in creative ways.

We also encourage on-line events taking place before and/or during NeurIPS.


## Instructions for Submission

**The proposers should prepare a 3-minute video or recorded slide show presentation to be linked to the proposal.** This video should present the artists’ portfolio and give an impression of what the exhibit will show. It will be treated confidentially as the rest of the proposal by the reviewers. 

Proposals on this year’s theme **“Celebrating Diversity”**, are due on June 15, 2023.

Submissions are made by filling out this [FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fw0XUJ84R6kP4QigiI9-2boycRqpzQCiRfbNRda37SY/edit).

Accepted exhibitors will have the opportunity to present the technical aspects of their work as a poster (poster boards made available upon request), and have the final version of their proposal and video linked from the virtual exhibition webpage (after taking into account the comments of the reviewers). In addition, they are encouraged to submit papers to the NeurIPS conference. The proposers can optionally volunteer to submit a joint workshop proposal. We will put them in touch with one-another.

# FAQ

#### Q: Could you elaborate more on the theme "Celebrating Diversity"?
A: We generally mean the diversity of our community, e.g., in the context of geographic, cultural, or technical diversity. We believe that such diversity encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and brings about unique creativity in the research field. As in a paper review, the relevance to the theme will be used during the selection process.  

#### Q: Is there a stipend of any kind provided for travel to and from the event for selected proposals?
A: Currently, the Creative AI track does not have funding to support the participants. If this information changes in the future, we will share that on our website. 

#### Q: Are we allowed to submit papers for our work in other conferences?
A: Yes, this year is a trial run and we do not impose that people only submit at NeurIPS. Since we are only accepting artworks this year, it is OK even if your paper has been submitted elsewhere. This may change in years to come. 
 
#### Q: Can I submit 2 projects? Would I need a separate 3 minute presentation for each, or should this media include both as well as other relevant projects in my portfolio? 
A: Yes. Please submit a separate proposal for each project. The video submission of your prior work relevant to the proposed project should be submitted to demonstrate the strength of the proposed work. 

#### Q: We are looking for opportunities for our work to be published. Does the Creative AI track include some form of publication or citation for our work to be referenced in the future?
A: No, this track will not have a formal publication. You will have the opportunity of presenting a poster.

#### Q: Do we need to include technical details about our work in the proposal (similar to a demo track paper ) ?
A: Technical details in the proposal would be a plus. This is indeed a new version of a demo track. You can accompany your demo with a poster to explain your techniques. Posters will be displayed on the NeurIPS website.

#### Q: What we should include in the 3-minute video?
A: You are free to present anything you want to convince the jury that what you will show will be exciting and fulfill the review criteria indicated on our website.

#### Q: Do you have any past examples of portfolio videos that I could view as a reference?
A: This is the first year of this track, so there are no past examples. 

#### Q: I see that an alternate format for presenting the video is a recorded slideshow format. Does this have to be an in-person recording or can it be a screen-recorded slideshow with a voiceover?
A: Either way is fine.

#### Q: Is the 3 minute video duration a minimum requirement, or a cutoff? 
A: This is not a strict requirement but please do not exceed 4 minutes.

#### Q: Are web-based demonstrations appropriate for this track ?
A: We welcome on-line demonstrations, particularly if they engage the audience in some way. This could take place before and during the event. However, we also would like to have something interesting and engaging during the event. You could make use of a space we will reserve to you to show your demonstration on-site on a large screen for instance. Think of a way of making it engaging and fun for the audience. Maybe have the audience contribute to the generation and print poems that can take away with them.

#### Q: Is the review going to be double-blind or can we include our personal information?
A: This is single blind. 

#### Q: I want to use existing generative AI tools and wonder if there is a way to accelerate the timeline of getting approval to use them (closed beta, waitlist, etc).
A: We understand your problem. However, this is part of the research we expect the participants to conduct. Hopefully the track will reveal which tools exist, their availability, possible gaps and hurdles that will need to be addressed in the future.
