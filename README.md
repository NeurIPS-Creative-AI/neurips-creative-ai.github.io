# FAQ

### Q: Could you elaborate more on the theme "Celebrating Diversity"?
A: We generally mean the diversity of our community, e.g., in the context of geographic, cultural, or technical diversity. We believe that such diversity encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and brings about unique creativity in the research field.As in a paper review, the relevance to the theme will be used during the selection process.  
 
### Q: Can I submit 2 projects? Would I need a separate 3 minute presentation for each, or should this media include both as well as other relevant projects in my portfolio? 
A: Yes. Please submit a separate proposal for each project. The video submission of your prior work relevant to the proposed project should be submitted to demonstrate the strength of the proposed work. 
 
### Q: Do you have any past examples of portfolio videos that I could view as a reference?
A: This is the first year of this track, so there are no past examples. 

### Q: Is there a stipend of any kind provided for travel to and from the event for selected proposals?
A: Currently, the Creative AI track does not have funding to support the participants. If this information changes in the future, we will share that on our website. 

### Q: I see that an alternate format for presenting the video is a recorded slideshow format. Does this have to be an in-person recording or can it be a screen-recorded slideshow with a voiceover?
A: Either way is fine.

### Q: Is the 3 minute video duration a minimum requirement, or a cutoff? 
A: This is not a strict requirement but please do not exceed 4 minutes.
